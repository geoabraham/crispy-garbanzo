# Practicing Cracking Codes with Python

[*Cracking Codes with Python*](http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/) teaches complete beginners how to program in the
Python programming language. The book features the source code to several ciphers and hacking programs for these
ciphers. The programs include the Caesar cipher, transposition cipher, simple substitution cipher, multiplicative &
affine ciphers, Vigenere cipher, and hacking programs for each of these ciphers. The final chapters cover the modern RSA
cipher and public key cryptography.

Cracking Codes with Python is the 2nd edition of the previously-titled
book, [Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/hacking).
